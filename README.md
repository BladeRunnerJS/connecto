# Connecto

----
## What is Connecto?
A game that follows the same rules as the popular children's game Connect 4, where each player attempts to connect four of his or her own discs next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The main difference with Connecto is that one must first earn the right to drop the disc by identifying the correct translation for the image displayed.

## The code
A good starting point to understand how the app is constructed would be by looking at [index.html](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/connecto/blob/master/default-aspect/index.html) and [App.js](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/connecto/blob/master/default-aspect/src/connecto/App.js)
